    "**Q1: What is Data Loading in Power BI and why is it considered the first step of analysis?**\n",
    "- Data Loading in Power BI means importing data from different sources (Excel, CSV, databases, APIs, cloud services, etc.) into Power BI so it can be analyzed and visualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is considered the first step of analysis because:\n",
    "  - Without loading data, there is nothing to analyze or visualize.\n",
    "  - It helps Power BI understand the structure of the data (columns, data types, rows).\n",
    "  - It allows us to check whether the data is complete, relevant, and usable.\n",
    "  - All next steps like data cleaning (Power Query), modeling (relationships, DAX), and report building depend on the data that is loaded first.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Explain the difference between “Load” and “Transform Data” in Power BI.**\n",
    "- Load:\n",
    "  - Load means directly importing the data into Power BI as it is.\n",
    "  - The data is brought into the Power BI data model without any changes.\n",
    "  - It is used when the data is already clean and well-structured.\n",
    "  - Faster, but gives no control over cleaning or shaping the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transform Data:\n",
    "  - Transform Data opens Power Query Editor.\n",
    "  - It is used to clean, modify, and shape the data before loading it.\n",
    "  - e.g.- removing duplicates, changing data types, splitting columns, filtering rows.\n",
    "  - Ensures data quality and better analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3: What is a Fact Table and a Dimension Table? Give examples from the dataset.**\n",
    "- **Fact Table**\n",
    "  - A Fact Table stores quantitative, numerical data that we analyze and aggregate.\n",
    "  - It usually contains measures like counts, totals, or sums.\n",
    "  - It also has foreign keys that connect to dimension tables.\n",
    "  - Example from the Corona_Virus_2020 dataset:\n",
    "    - Confirmed_Cases\n",
    "    - Recovered_Cases\n",
    "    - Deaths\n",
    "    - Active_Cases\n",
    "    - Tests_Conducted\n",
    "    - Hospitalized\n",
    "\n",
    "- These columns represent measurable values, so the main COVID records table acts as a fact table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimension Table**\n",
    "  - A Dimension Table stores descriptive information used to slice and filter data.\n",
    "  - It answers questions like when, where, and who.\n",
    "  - Example dimensions from the dataset:\n",
    "    - Date\n",
    "    - Country\n",
    "    - State\n",
    "    - Vaccination_Status\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4: Why is Star Schema preferred over Snowflake Schema in Power BI?**\n",
    "- **Star Schema is preferred because:**\n",
    "  - It has a simple structure: one fact table connected directly to multiple dimension tables.\n",
    "  - Better performance: fewer joins mean faster query execution.\n",
    "  - Easy to understand for both developers and business users.\n",
    "  - Simpler DAX calculations due to fewer relationships.\n",
    "  - Works best with Power BI’s in-memory (VertiPaq) engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Snowflake Schema drawbacks in Power BI:**\n",
    "  - More tables and relationships.\n",
    "  - Complex joins reduce performance.\n",
    "  - Harder to write and maintain DAX measures.\n",
