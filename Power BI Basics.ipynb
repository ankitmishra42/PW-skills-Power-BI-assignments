    "**Q3: Explain the Power BI workflow.**\n",
    "- **Connect to Data Sources:** First, we import data from databases, files, APIs, or cloud services.\n",
    "- **Transform Data:** Then, we clean and shape the data using Power Query.\n",
    "- **Data Modeling:** After that, we create relationships, measures, and calculated columns using DAX.\n",
    "- **Build Reports:** Next, we design interactive visualizations and reports in Power BI Desktop.\n",
